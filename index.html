                <h1>Why coding?</h1>
                <p>Coding and I have been secretly in love my entire adult life but we never quite managed to get together, until now.</p>

                <p>For many years I have dabbled. As a teenager I became obsessed by it and even started a degree but dropped out, partly because of the industry's toxic culture back in the day. In my work over the subsequent decades as a roving IT guy and volunteer tech for various causes and collectives around London I came to see how hamstrung many organisations are for the want of good, affordable software - volunteer groups and charities in particular. I had a lot of charity customers as, at the time, I was the only technician in my area offering significant discount rates for non-profits and the unwaged. Pleasingly, open-source software was beginning to flourish at that time so I was able to hook many of them up with solutions that had been well beyond their means a few years earlier.</p>

                <p>As IT setups got more advanced more and more clients started asking me to do tweaks, updates, migrations, fixes and backups of their various websites, servers and databases. This is the point at which most technicians tell their customers they need to get a specialist in but I felt bad for them. The costs were often too high for most of these tiny organisations, I had seen some of them get gouged in the past, so instead I started dabbling in whatever language was required. I wouldn't charge them my hourly rate as I was no expert and they couldn't afford to pay commercial rates anyway. Over the years I also found a growing number of things I wanted to automate for my business. Eventually it became clear that these jobs made no financial sense and I hadn't been entirely motivated by altruism, they were a flimsy pretext to do some coding. Despite this admission I was still quite serious about my vow to never become a career programmer. Also, being self-employed meant I wasn't exactly time rich so for many years I had to content myself with these occasional shallow dives.</p>

                <p>That began to change when my wife returned to work after our second child. We decided to wind up my business so I could be a full time dad and "domestic engineer" til the kids were both at school. A few years in, once the delerium of sleep deprivation had abated, I started reading books about programming for the first time. Hitherto I had only read programming manuals but once I started on  the conceptual stuff I quickly got sucked into the world of Martin Fowler, Kent Beck, Bob Martin et al. From there it wasn't long til I got religion.</p>
                
                <p>It seemed in the years since I had first flirted with programming the industry had taken some big steps forward. The best practices and agile methodologies I read about were a real breath of fresh air, and stunningly obvious in retrospect. Ditching the lumbering waterfall model for quick itterations, taking testing seriously, involving clients throughout the project, using user stories as specs - it was like a light coming on. In particular I found the notion of pair programming very exciting.</p>
            
            <div id="stark_truths">

                <p>Of course all that reading forced me to face some stark truths...
                    <ul id="truth_bullets">
                    <li>I love coding at a fundamental level and I must do it, and do it often, to remain sane.</li>
                    <li>I have been a terrible cowboy coder in the past. Now I must knuckle downa and apply best practice and missionary zeal to become a real professional.</li>
                    <li>Coding takes <strong>a lot</strong> of time, coding well takes even more, and I don't really have that kind of spare time outside of my day to day commitments.</li>
                    <li>The only way I will be able to spend as much time coding as I want to is for it to become my full time profession.
                    <li>I have coded alone for 20 years with no colleagues or peers to talk to and learn from.</li>
                    <li>Coding alone is rather limiting and lonely. I want people to use what I write and I want to work on non trivial projects that actually help people.</li>
                    <li>Much as I love programming for it's own sake I would much prefer to work for an organisation with a social purpose, or at least conscience, and not just a generic consultancy or fintech firm.</li>
                    <li>At the same time I am itching to try things like agile development and pair programming that I have read about.</li>
                    <li>By definition this means team work but I have almost no experience of working on a team yet.  The Founders and Coders sessions I have attended so far have strengthened me in the opinion that working closely with others is what I crave and what would benefit me the most right now.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

            </section>
            <section id="why_fac">
                <h1>Why Founders and Coders?</h1>
                <p>My friend and long time co-op evanglist put me on to Founders and Coders. I was telling him how I would love to do a boot camp but the fees on top of the extra childcare costs and the opportunity cost of not working made it seem pretty unattainable. Obviously when he then explained Founders and Coders to me I got very excited. Everything he told me about the organisation and it's ethos resonated with me and I resolved to apply as soon a the kids we're in school.</p>
                <p>The peer led, paying it forward model makes a ton of sense. Its a great model for how people should work together and help each other learn, especially as the costs of tertiary education are now so prohibitive.</p>
                <p>The focus on increasing representation for people who don't neccessarily fit the &quot;traditional&quot; junior programmer mold is really positive, especially as someone who isn't nearly as junior as your average junior. The painfully skewed demographics of the programming industry were one of the things that pushed me away from it back in the day.</p>
                <p>I love the focus on pairing too, it is something I have wanted to try ever since I heard about it and the Monday and Tuesday F&amp;C sessions have been a great opportunity to try it out. Happily I like it as much as I'd hoped and I've learned something from every session I have taken part in.</p>
                <p>The roster of companies who hire from the program include a really encouraging number of social enterprises and progressive businesses. These are the kind of places I want to work.</p>
                <p>Overall I can't imagine a course that is a better fit for me than Founders and Coders, regardless of cost. The crowd it seems to attract are the kind of people I would seek out anyway. I don't think it's that big a coincidence that just before the second F&amp;C meetup I attended I bumped into one of my ex-clients from back in the day. We got to chatting about what I was up to and I told her my youngest had just started school full time and that I was retraining and was on my way to a programming meetup. &quot;Ooh is it Founders and Coders?&quot; she replied, &quot;we,'ve just come from there - they made us an app!&quot;.</p>
