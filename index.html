                <h1>Why coding?</h1>
                <p>Coding and I have been secretly in love my entire adult life but we never quite managed to get it together, until now.</p>

                <p>For many years I have dabbled. As a teenager I became obsessed with coding, starting a software engineering degree at eighteen but not liking the culture and switching to media tech within a couple of years. The programming industry norms seemed toxic to me and I wasn't yet used to people as insular as my fellow students.</p>
                
                <p>In my work over the subsequent decades - as a roving IT guy and volunteer tech for various causes and collectives I came to see how hamstrung many organisations are for the want of good, affordable software. I offered substantial discounts for non-profits and the unwaged, so I got to see inside a lot of small charities and groups who could not afford proper commercial grade software. Pleasingly though open-source software was beginning to flourish around then so I was able to hook many of them up with solutions that had been well beyond their means a few years earlier. The free software movement greatly impressed me. Particularly impressive was the massive impact a relatively small number of coders could have .</p>

                <p>As IT setups got more advanced more and more clients started asking me to do tweaks, updates, migrations, fixes and backups of their various websites, servers, and databases. This is the point at which most technicians tell their customers they need to hire a specialist but you can probably guess I didn't do that. The costs were too high for most of these tiny organisations. I had seen several of them get gouged in the past, especially on web stuff, so instead I started dabbling in whatever language was required. I wouldn't charge my full hourly rate as I was just an amateur, learning on the hoof, and they couldn't afford to pay commercial rates anyway.
                    
                <p>Over the years, I also switched over to Linux and found a growing number of things I wanted to automate for my business. Eventually it became clear that these programming "jobs" made no financial sense and I hadn't been entirely motivated by altruism - they were a flimsy pretext to do some coding. Despite this admission I was still quite serious about my vow to never become a career programmer. I didn't want to sully what had now become my favourite hobby. Also, being self-employed meant I wasn't exactly blessed with regular leisure time so for many years I had to content myself with these occasional shallow dives.</p>

                <p>That began to change when my wife returned to work after our second child. We decided to wind up my business so I could become a full time dad and "domestic engineer" until the kids were both at school. Computer history is one of my long term interests so I'd read plenty of books about that but a few years into my new life, once the delirium of sleep deprivation had abated, I finally picked up a book about programming. Hitherto I had only read programming manuals but once I started on the conceptual stuff I quickly got sucked into the world of Martin Fowler, Kent Beck, Bob Martin et al. From there it wasn't long till I got religion.</p>

                <p>It looked like the software industry had taken some big steps forward since the 1990s. The best practices and agile methodologies I read about were a real breath of fresh air, and stunningly obvious in retrospect. Ditching the lumbering waterfall model for quick iterations; taking testing seriously; involving clients throughout the project; using user stories as specs - it was like a light coming on. In particular I found the notion of pair programming very exciting.</p>

            <div id="stark_truths">

                <p>Of course all that reading forced me to face some stark truths...
                    <ul id="truth_bullets">
                    <li>I love coding at a fundamental level and I must do it, and do it often, to remain sane.</li>
                    <li>I have been a terrible cowboy coder in the past. Now I must knuckle down and apply best practice to become a professional.</li>
                    <li>Coding takes <strong>a lot</strong> of time, coding well takes even more, and I don't really have that kind of spare time outside of my day to day commitments.</li>
                    <li>Coding becoming my full time profession is the only way I will be able to spend as much time on it as I want.
                    <li>I have coded alone for 20 years with no colleagues or peers to talk to and learn from.</li>
                    <li>Coding alone is limiting and lonely. I want people to use what I write and I want to work on non trivial projects that help people.</li>
                    <li>I love programming for it's own sake, but I would strongly prefer to work for an organisation with a social purpose, or at least conscience, and not just a generic consultancy or fintech firm.</li>
                    <li>I am itching to try techniques like agile development and pair programming that I have read about.</li>
                    <li>By definition this means team work: but I have no experience of working on a team. The Founders and Coders sessions I have attended so far have strengthened my opinion that working closely with others is what I crave, and what would benefit me the most as a programmer.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section id="why_fac">
                <h1>Why Founders and Coders?</h1>
                <p>My friend and long time co-op evangelist put me on to Founders and Coders. I told him that I would love to do a boot camp but the fees, on top of the extra childcare costs and the opportunity cost of not working, made it seem pretty unattainable. Naturally when he explained Founders and Coders to me I got very excited. Everything he told me about the organisation and its ethos resonated with me. I resolved to apply as soon a the kids were in school.</p>
                <p>The peer led, paying it forward model makes a ton of sense. Its a great model for how we should all work together and help each other learn, especially as the costs of tertiary education have risen so high.</p>
                <p>The focus on increasing representation for people who don't necessarily fit the &quot;traditional&quot; junior programmer mould is really positive, especially as someone who isn't as junior as your average junior. The painfully skewed demographics of the programming industry were one of the things that pushed me away from it back in the day.</p>
                <p>I love the focus on pairing too. It is something I have wanted to try ever since I heard about it.  The Monday and Tuesday F&amp;C sessions have been a great opportunity to try it out. Happily, I like it as much as I'd hoped and I've learned something from every session I have taken part in.</p>
                <p>The roster of companies who hire from the program include a really encouraging number of social enterprises and progressive businesses. These are the kind of places I want to work.</p>
                <p>Overall I can't imagine a course that is a better fit for me than Founders and Coders, regardless of cost. The crowd it seems to attract are the kind of people I would seek out anyway. I don't think it's a big coincidence that just before the second F&amp;C meetup I went to I bumped into one of my ex-clients from back in the day. Chatting about what I was up to, I told her my youngest had just started school and that I was retraining. In fact I was on my way to a programming meetup right now. &quot;Ooh, is it Founders and Coders?&quot; she asked, &quot;we've just come from there - they made us an app!&quot;.</p>

                <h1>What I've Learned</h1>
                <figure>
                    <figcaption><h2>Some key findings, in no particular order:</h2></figcaption>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is important to concentrate on the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), and not get carried away trying to implement too many features up front. This is the YAGNI principle from extreme programming which I had read about but forgot to heed</li>
                        <li>Getting checkboxes to scale nicely across browsers is no picnic. Pick your battles wisely!</li>
                        <li>If you don't check with a screen reader you <em>will</em> have screen reader issues and, likewise, you can't assume keyboard navigation will just work. It needs testing.</li>
                        <li>CSS Transitions and Animations are very powerful, if tricky to debug.  They should be used in favour of Javascript for most animations. Resist the temptation to stick with what you know, because what is new is probably an improvement</li>
                        <li>Scroll-padding is handy if you have fixed/absolute elements, but browser support can be rather fickle right now.</li>
                        <li>Viewport units (vw and vh) do not take account of scrollbars, which can lead to some subtle but annoying layout errors.</li>
                        <li>CSS variables are great for reducing repetition and marshalling settings in one place. Being able to set them in media queries helps avoid duplication and bloat.</li>
                        <li>I find frontend code harder to write, largely because it is not obvious how to leverage automated testing. It may just be my ignorance but it appears frontend code and layout are much more liable to change, requiring frequent rewriting and scrapping of tests and so not really favouring test driven development. Also, several things one might want to test look prohibitively complicated to test automatically e.g. CSS calculations, Transitions, timers, network conditions, varying screen sizes, and browser cross compatibility.</li>
                        <li>The amount of time I spend correcting unwanted auto-completions in VSCode is almost as much time as it saves me in the first place, maybe more some days!</li>
