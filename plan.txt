Include an image carousel (the image carousel must be built into your website, a link to a separate page or CodePen will not be accepted)

  Spec
    Responsive (works on mobile and desktop)
    Display one image at a time
    Move between images when clicking navigation buttons
    Toggle automatically looping through all images with a play/pause button
    Allow keyboard navigation between images with the left/right arrow keys

  Goals
    High priority...
      DO Whole page should be very accessible - test with a screen reader
      DO Should work with a flexible number of images.
      DO Should be able to start before all images have been downloaded with more images added as they arrive
      DO Should be configurable without touching the code files e.g. using a text or json file
    Would be nice
      LATER Permit more than one transition e.g. crossfade, left wipe, right wipe etc.
      LATER Allow smaller alternative image files so not to waste bandwidth for small screens
      LATER make carousel a web component?

    FEATURES

      Spellcheck and correct copy
    
      Test navigation using only keyboard.

      Incorporate my notes on HTML, CSS etc
      Link to github of this file
      Link to git log?

      Further testing with screen reader
        Yikes, Orca starts reporting each individual carousel transition
          Assume this is some kind of focus issue
          Investigate how to stop it!
        Any way to test with something that isn't Orka?
          Maybe test on a windows box?

      Investigate other color schemes
        paying attention to contrast ratio for accessibility
          Specify colors with hls so this is eay to check
            Using following vars to specify the two gradient fills
              --LGA-start, --LGA-end, --LGB-start, --LGB-end

      Write another transition or two

    BUGS

      Checkbox does not scale. The rest of the carousel scales fine but checkboxes don't
        Solutions?
          There are lots of gnarly looking hacksbut hacks are hard to maintain
            and I don't have all the different browsers to test it in
          Use a different element
            Could replace with a pause/play graphic
            Could replace with fake checkboxa


  
  DONE
    Learning section icons may be unneccesarily large, check and scale down if OTT
    Added new breakpoint at 350px to change text justification to left
      as justify starts to look silly at that size.
    In smallest layout a horizontal scroll appears
      Prob occurs when scaling section to 100vw as vw units
      shockingly, don't take account of the width of scroll bars!
      Could fix this by using calc to adjust but that seems a bit
      fussy/hacky and there are browsers I can't test that on easily
      so I have added overflow-x: hidden to the body.
    Decided against - Refactor so svg buttons don't need scaling by 50%;
      Tried doing that but turns out of the SVG is already at 100% and you use
      css to scale it to 105% it changes the size of it's container and breaks the
      layout so it's actually better to scale it down first and give yourself the
      headroom to scale it up later.
    Low speed testing - using chrome dev tools throttle feature.
      Refactored placeholder gif into parent element and removed surplus div
      Verified placeholder downloaded and shown first
      Verified carousel starts as soonas first two images arrive
    Serious cleanup of css and HTML code, there's loads of dead code in there now
      45lines of cssand several divs, ids and a class removed
    Incorporate icons for: FCC, GitHub, Codewars
    Added navigation links along top
    Decided against burger menu, nav menu switches to column in small screen layout now.
    Make control overlay invisible by default
      done. Make visible on hover for mouse users
      done. Make visible by clicking for touchscreens
        Turns out that's how it works by default anyway :)
    Re-enable loading placeholder animation
    MANUAL NAVIGATION
      Make transitions fast in manual mode
      Switch to manual mode if l/r buttons or arrow keys are used
      Wire up back and forward buttons
      Wire up left/right arrow keys
      Wire up 'A' key to toggle automatic mode
      Wire up automatic checkbox
    Finalise and insert copy
      Size text nicely for each breakpoint then
      Re-evaluate if square layout is still appropriate
        Changed from box layout to plain flowing text
    Choose nice background colors for each section
    ACCESSIBILITY ADJUSTMENTS
      Made title more descriptive
      Improve nav contrast for accessibility.
    FIXED BUGS
      Learning icons pop out of the body at very large sizes
      scroll-padding-top only working in chromium
        Turns out it works in FF & Chrome but firefox only obeys it if it is set
          inside of the 'html' element in the css!
          I had been setting it within 'body'.
        Support not quite universal - no IE no Edge and Safari is in preview.
      loading.gif not displaying despite being downloaded in throttled test
      Label text is pushedout of box
      Fixed padding on lists
      In phone layout first H1 (Why Coding?) top padding looks to be missing
        Unwanted border collapsing, fixed by adding margin to carousel section.
