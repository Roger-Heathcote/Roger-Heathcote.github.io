Include an image carousel (the image carousel must be built into your website, a link to a separate page or CodePen will not be accepted)

  Spec
    Responsive (works on mobile and desktop)
    Display one image at a time
    Move between images when clicking navigation buttons
    Toggle automatically looping through all images with a play/pause button
    Allow keyboard navigation between images with the left/right arrow keys

  Goals
    High priority...
      DO Whole page should be very accessible - test with a screen reader
      DO Should work with a flexible number of images.
      DO Should permit more than one transition e.g. crossfade, left wipe, right wipe etc.
    Would be nice
      DO Should be able to start before all images have been downloaded with more images added as they arrive
      DO Should be configurable without touching the code files e.g. using a text or json file
      LATER Allow smaller alternative image files so not to waste bandwidth for small screens
      LATER make carousel a web component?

    FEATURES

      Need serious cleanup of css code, there's loads of dead code in there now
    
      Write another transition or two
      
      Test navigation using only keyboard.

      Further testing with screen reader
        Yikes, Orca starts reporting each individual carousel transition
          Assume this is some kind of focus issue
          Investigate how to stop it!
        Any way to test with something that isn't Orka?
          Maybe test on a windows box?

      Incorporate my notes on HTML, CSS etc

      Investigate other color schemes
        paying attention to contrast ratio for accessibility
          Specify colors with hls so this is eay to check
            Using following vars to specify the two gradient fills
              --LGA-start, --LGA-end, --LGB-start, --LGB-end

    BUGS
      Checkbox does not scale. The rest of the carousel scales fine but checkboxes don't
      In phone layout first H1 (Why Coding?) top padding looks to be missing
    
  DONE
    Incorporate icons for: FCC, GitHub, Codewars
    Added navigation links along top
    Decided against burger menu, nav menu switches to column in small screen layout now.
    Make control overlay invisible by default
      done. Make visible on hover for mouse users
      done. Make visible by clicking for touchscreens
        Turns out that's how it works by default anyway :)
    Re-enable loading placeholder animation
    MANUAL NAVIGATION
      Make transitions fast in manual mode
      Switch to manual mode if l/r buttons or arrow keys are used
      Wire up back and forward buttons
      Wire up left/right arrow keys
      Wire up 'A' key to toggle automatic mode
      Wire up automatic checkbox
    Finalise and insert copy
      Size text nicely for each breakpoint then
      Re-evaluate if square layout is still appropriate
        Changed from box layout to plain flowing text
    Choose nice background colors for each section
    ACCESSIBILITY ADJUSTMENTS
      Made title more descriptive
      Improve nav contrast for accessibility.
    FIXED BUGS
        Label text is pushedout of box
        Fixed padding on lists
