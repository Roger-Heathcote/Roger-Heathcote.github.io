  HIGH PRIORITY

    Chrome Audits - fix aspect ration.

    Spellcheck and correct copy

    Sanity check: double check all required FCC modules completed
    Sanity check: double check if github link is the one they asked for

    Incorporate LEARNING EXTRAS

  LOW PRIORITY

    Further testing with screen reader
    Any way to test with something that isn't Orka?
      Maybe test on a windows box?

    Investigate other color schemes
      paying attention to contrast ratio for accessibility
        Specify colors with hls so this is eay to check
          Using following vars to specify the two gradient fills
            --LGA-start, --LGA-end, --LGB-start, --LGB-end

  LONGER TERM

    Permit more than one transition e.g. crossfade, left wipe, right wipe etc.
    Allow smaller alternative image files so not to waste bandwidth for small screens
    Make carousel into a web component


APPENDIXES

  LEARNING EXTRAS

    Incorporate my notes on HTML, CSS etc

    Checkbox does not scale. The rest of the carousel scales fine but checkboxes don't
      Solutions?
        There are lots of gnarly looking hacksbut hacks are hard to maintain
          and I don't have all the different browsers to test it in
        Use a different element
          Could replace with a pause/play graphic
          Could replace with fake checkbox

    Occasional error in console.
      Error in parsing value for 'transform'. Declaration dropped. 127.0.0.1:5501:3:42
      Cannot duplicate as of yet. Seems to just turn up when browser is left alone for a while.
      Doesn't have any noticable effect as far as I can tell.

  Factor out use of !important in force_overlay_visible
    Plan B: Augment carousel elements with classes and change css to use classes, leave JS alone.
      Worked first time and was simpler than I had hoped.
      Only needed add a single class name to the html, and change the selector of one CSS rule.
      Feeling pretty proud of my understanding of CSS selector priority right now! :)
  Demonstrate your learning from the prerequisites
    Basic JavaScript
    ES6
    Basic Data Structures
    Basic Algorithm Scripting
  Tell us about why you are applying for the programme
    Copy is now in index.html
    Links to github, FCC and codewars
    Links in index.html
  Spec
    Include an image carousel (the image carousel must be built into your website, a link to a separate page or CodePen will not be accepted)
    Responsive (works on mobile and desktop)
    Display one image at a time
    Move between images when clicking navigation buttons
    Toggle automatically looping through all images with a play/pause button
    Allow keyboard navigation between images with the left/right arrow keys
  Goals
    High priority...
      DO Whole page should be very accessible - test with a screen reader
      DO Should work with a flexible number of images
      DO Should be able to start before all images have been downloaded with more images added as they arrive
      DO Should be configurable without touching the code files e.g. using a text or json file
  Get rid of multiple transitions mechanism
    It is broken and there isn't time to fix/redo it
  Keyboard navigation testing
  Learning section icons may be unneccesarily large, check and scale down if OTT
  Added new breakpoint at 350px to change text justification to left
    as justify starts to look silly at that size
  In smallest layout a horizontal scroll appears
    Prob occurs when scaling section to 100vw as vw units
    shockingly, don't take account of the width of scroll bars!
    Could fix this by using calc to adjust but that seems a bit
    fussy/hacky and there are browsers I can't test that on easily
    so I have added overflow-x: hidden to the body
  Decided against - Refactor so svg buttons don't need scaling by 50%;
    Tried doing that but turns out of the SVG is already at 100% and you use
    css to scale it to 105% it changes the size of it's container and breaks the
    layout so it's actually better to scale it down first and give yourself the
    headroom to scale it up later
  Low speed testing - using chrome dev tools throttle feature.
    Refactored placeholder gif into parent element and removed surplus div
    Verified placeholder downloaded and shown first
    Verified carousel starts as soonas first two images arrive
  Serious cleanup of css and HTML code, there's loads of dead code in there now
    45lines of cssand several divs, ids and a class removed
  Incorporate icons for: FCC, GitHub, Codewars
  Added navigation links along top
  Decided against burger menu, nav menu switches to column in small screen layout now.
  Make control overlay invisible by default
    done. Make visible on hover for mouse users
    done. Make visible by clicking for touchscreens
      Turns out that's how it works by default anyway :)
  Re-enable loading placeholder animation
  MANUAL NAVIGATION
    Make transitions fast in manual mode
    Switch to manual mode if l/r buttons or arrow keys are used
    Wire up back and forward buttons
    Wire up left/right arrow keys
    Wire up 'A' key to toggle automatic mode
    Wire up automatic checkbox
  Finalise and insert copy
    Size text nicely for each breakpoint then
    Re-evaluate if square layout is still appropriate
      Changed from box layout to plain flowing text
  Choose nice background colors for each section

ACCESSIBILITY
ACCESSIBILITY
ACCESSIBILITY
  Made title more descriptive
  Improved nav contrast for accessibility
  Carousel buttons are graphical, added aria-labels to describe them
  Also added explanatory aria-label for Automatic checkbox
  Made sure carousel controls become visible when their element become focussed during tabbing

BUGFIXES
BUGFIXES
BUGFIXES
  Fixed bug in getImageList that would have prevented retrying. Was calling the wrong function to retry!
  Keyboard navigation broke hover!
    More specifically the code I wrote to control overlay visibility using opacity broke hover!
    Overlay hover just stops working if overlay is set to 0 in JavaScript
    Banged my head against it for ages, suspect someting to do with stacking contexts. Gave up.
    Changed tack to use classes so css can mess with the opacity instead
    That works but had to use !important - boo! Shouldn't be too hard to
    factor out by cahnging carousle ids to less specific classes.
  Carousel control overlay was hidden by default
    Now focus events are checked and the overlay is made visible
    When tabbing within it
  Top three menu items have visible focus indicators - the three links at the bottom don't
    Added outline to all 9 focusable elements
  Orca starts reporting each individual carousel transition
    Removed "carousel" sectionfrom the tab flow by setting tab-index to -1.
  H1 checkbox is indented twice as much as the paragraphs
  Learning icons pop out of the body at very large sizes
  scroll-padding-top only working in chromium
    Turns out it works in FF & Chrome but firefox only obeys it if it is set
      inside of the 'html' element in the css!
      I had been setting it within 'body'
    Support not quite universal - no IE no Edge and Safari is in preview
  loading.gif not displaying despite being downloaded in throttled test
  Label text is pushedout of box
  Fixed padding on lists
  In phone layout first H1 (Why Coding?) top padding looks to be missing
    Unwanted border collapsing, fixed by adding margin to carousel section
