Tell us about why you are applying for the programme

  Personal reasons
    I can't stop coding. I have tried over the years and have met with some success but it has always been short lived.
    I convinced myself I didn't want to work in the programming industry as a youth but I keep finding excuse to come back to it.
    Often these excuses have just been flimsy pretexts.
    After decades of self denial I had an epihany a couple of years back and got religion, good practice wise.
    Since then I have had to face some stark truths...
      I love coding at a fundamental level and I must do it, and do it often, to remain sane.
      I have been a cowboy coder and a lone wolf in the past, I must now undo all that and become a (paragon of virtue||professional||upstanding citizen)?.
      Coding takes a lot of time, coding well takes even more, and I don't have that kind of spare time.
      Coding alone is limiting and lonely, I want people to use what I write and I want to work on non trivial projects.
      This means team work but I have no experience of working on a team.
      The only way I can spend as much time coding as I want to is for it to become my profession.

  The course itself

    I have been thinking about boot camps for a while but adding the expense of tens of thousands in fees on top of
    the extra childcare costs and the opportunity cost of not working for several months made them seem rather unattainable.
    I was explaining all this to a friend of mine who is a co-op evangilist and he told me about Founders and Coders.
    I immediately got very excited.
    Everything about the organisation and it's ethos seems right to me.
    The peer led, paying it forward model is fantastic, it is how we should all work together and help each other learn.
    The focus on increasing representation for people who might not fit the traditional junior programmer mold is really positive (and, for me, germane.)?
    The roster of companies who hire from the program include a heartening number of social enterprises and progressive businesses, the kind of places I would ideally like to work.
