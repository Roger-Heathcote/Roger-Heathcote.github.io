Tell us about why you are applying for the programme

  Personal reasons
    I can't stop coding. I have tried over the years and have met with some success but it has always been short lived.
    At 16 I caught the programming bug at college and became somewhat obsessed.
    At 18 I enrolled on a Software Engineering degree to pursue my new passion.
    By 21 I had dropped out. I didn't like the town, or my classmates or the course. I was bitterly disappointed.
    I vowed to never work as a programmer or a software engineer.
    I stopped programming and enrolled on a multimedia course, which I enjoyed much more.
    After that I worked in IT support for a few years then set up shop as an IT support & repair guy.
    All was, more or less, well for the next 15 years.
    However I kept finding excuses to do a bit of coding here and there.
    With hindsight those excuses were just flimsy pretexts.
    After decades of self denial I had an epihany a few years back and got religion.
    I started reading books on best practices and agile methodologies*.
    Since then I have had to face some stark truths...
      I love coding at a fundamental level and I must do it, and do it often, to remain sane.
      I have been a terrible cowboy coder in the past. Now I want to become a real professional.
      Coding takes a lot of time, coding well takes even more, and I don't really have that kind of spare time.
      Coding alone is limiting and lonely, I want people to use what I write and I want to work on non trivial projects.
      I have worked alone for 20 years with no colleagues or peers to talk to and learn from.
      At the same time I am itching to try things like agile development and pair programming that I have read about.
      This means team work but I have no experience of working on a team.
      The only way I can spend as much time coding as I want to is for it to become my profession.

  The course itself

    I have been thinking about boot camps for a while but adding the expense of tens of thousands in fees on top of
    the extra childcare costs and the opportunity cost of not working for several months made them seem rather unattainable.
    I was explaining all this to a friend of mine who is a co-op evangilist and he told me about Founders and Coders.
    I immediately got very excited.
    Everything about the organisation and it's ethos seems perfect to me.
    The peer led, paying it forward model is fantastic. It is how we should all work together and help each other learn.
    The focus on increasing representation for people who might not fit the traditional junior programmer mold is really positive (and, for me, germane.)?
    The roster of companies who hire from the program include a heartening number of social enterprises and progressive businesses, the kind of places I want to work.

Include an image carousel (the image carousel must be built into your website, a link to a separate page or CodePen will not be accepted)
  Find some images to use
  Web components look interesting, maybe make the carousel a web component?
  Make sure it's responsive, Use @media to change styles for different sizes as required.
  FCC on making images responsive
      img {
      max-width: 100%;
      display: block;
      height: auto;
    }
    The max-width property of 100% scales the image to fit the width of its container,
    but the image won't stretch wider than its original width. Setting the display property
    to block changes the image from an inline element (its default), to a block element on
    its own line. The height property of auto keeps the original aspect ratio of the image.
